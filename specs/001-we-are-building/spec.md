# Feature Specification: Azure Managed Grafana Marketing Copilot & Page Redesign

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-are-building`  
**Created**: 2025-08-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "We are building a prototype of a dedicated Copilot for the Azure Managed Grafana marketing page, along with a redesigned version of the page itself. The goal is to improve user engagement, trust, and product understanding by replacing the current generic assistant with a context-aware, domain-specific Copilot and by restructuring the page to better support discovery and interaction. This initiative is based on user research showing that the current assistant lacks awareness of Azure Managed Grafana, fails to answer key comparative and evaluative questions, and suffers from poor UX integration. Users also found the marketing page overwhelming, unclear in its value proposition, and difficult to navigate. The prototype will demonstrate how a well-designed Copilot and a streamlined page layout can work together to enhance the customer journey and support product adoption. The Copilot must be tuned or trained on Azure Managed Grafana-specific documentation, FAQs, and curated product knowledge. It should default to answering in the context of Azure Managed Grafana, handle comparative questions (e.g., Grafana vs Azure Monitor) with balanced, factual responses, cite sources or link to documentation,and gracefully handle unknown queries with fallback suggestions. It should support a sidebar UI that does not overlap page content, allow resizing and scrolling, include a greeting message that sets expectations, offer copy buttons for code snippets, and respond quickly. Feedback mechanisms and analytics for query tracking must be implemented to support continuous improvement. The marketing page prototype will include clearer value propositions presented in bullet form, a prominent Getting Started call to action, an FAQ section addressing common comparison questions, improved navigation to documentation and trials, and visual elements such as customer logos or use cases. The page and Copilot should be designed to work in tandem, with the assistant linking to page sections and the page prompting users to engage with the Copilot at relevant moments. This prototype will serve as a proof of concept for how a product-specific Copilot and a well-structured marketing page can improve product discovery, reduce friction in decision-making, and increase confidence in Azure‚Äôs observability offerings."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a prospective or existing customer evaluating Azure observability options, I want the marketing page and an integrated Copilot that speaks with authority about Azure Managed Grafana, answers comparative and evaluative questions, and points me to clear next steps (documentation, trial, or contact), so I can make an informed adoption decision quickly and with confidence.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a visitor asks a comparative question (e.g., "Grafana vs Azure Monitor"), **When** the visitor asks via the Copilot, **Then** the Copilot returns a balanced, factual answer that includes at least one citation or link to Azure Managed Grafana documentation or FAQ, and an inline CTA to the FAQ or Getting Started section.

2. **Given** a visitor asks "How do I get started with Azure Managed Grafana?", **When** the Copilot responds, **Then** it provides a concise 3-step Getting Started flow with a direct link to start a trial or go to the quickstart documentation and includes a copyable example (if relevant).

3. **Given** the Copilot cannot answer with high confidence, **When** it detects low confidence, **Then** it returns a transparent fallback that: (a) says it cannot answer definitively, (b) offers suggested documentation links and next actions (search, contact sales, or trial), and (c) logs the query for analytics and improvement.

### Edge Cases
- Handling ambiguous queries with missing context: Copilot should ask 1‚Äì2 clarifying questions when necessary rather than guessing. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which contexts should trigger clarification vs fallback?]
- Logged-in vs anonymous user flows: behavior may differ for personalized recommendations. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: desired personalization level and required account context]
- Performance degradation or degraded model availability: Copilot should surface a graceful degraded UX and retain essential navigation links.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Product-focused answers ‚Äî The Copilot MUST default to the Azure Managed Grafana context and prioritize product-specific knowledge when answering.
  - Acceptance: For 20 sampled Copilot queries about Azure Managed Grafana, ‚â•95% responses reference Azure Managed Grafana and contain at least one product-specific citation or link. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: evaluation dataset and citation rubric]

- **FR-002**: Curated knowledge base ‚Äî The Copilot MUST be tuned on Azure Managed Grafana product docs, FAQs, and curated marketing content to ensure domain relevance.
  - Acceptance: Documentation links used in answers must resolve to official docs or curated KB entries; unresolved or broken links count as failure. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: source list for training/tuning]

- **FR-003**: Balanced comparative answers ‚Äî The Copilot MUST handle comparative/evaluative questions (e.g., Grafana vs Azure Monitor) by presenting balanced information, explicitly noting trade-offs, and citing sources.
  - Acceptance: Comparative responses include at least one trade-off statement and ‚â•1 documentation link.

- **FR-004**: Safe fallback behavior ‚Äî The Copilot MUST gracefully acknowledge unknowns (e.g., "I don't know for sure") and provide fallback suggestions (docs, contact, or clarifying questions) while logging the query for analysis.
  - Acceptance: Fallback path triggered when internal confidence < threshold. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: confidence threshold and telemetry design]

- **FR-005**: Page-integrated UI ‚Äî The Copilot UI (sidebar) MUST not overlap page content, MUST be resizable and scrollable, include a greeting message that sets expectations, and provide copy buttons for code snippets.
  - Acceptance: On a set of standard viewport sizes, the sidebar does not hide primary page content and resize controls function as expected. Copy button appears for code samples and places clipboard content on click.

- **FR-006**: Performance & responsiveness ‚Äî The Copilot SHOULD respond quickly and keep user perceived latency low.
  - Acceptance: Average response latency target to be defined. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: target latency SLA]

- **FR-007**: Feedback & analytics ‚Äî The system MUST capture query-level telemetry (query text, timestamp, confidence score, user action/follow-up) and provide an interface for collecting explicit user feedback (thumbs up/down, short comment).
  - Acceptance: Each user interaction should emit a structured telemetry event to the analytics pipeline. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: storage, retention, PII policy]

- **FR-008**: Redesigned marketing page elements ‚Äî The page prototype MUST present: (a) concise bullet-form value propositions, (b) a prominent Getting Started CTA, (c) an FAQ that addresses common comparison questions, (d) improved navigation to docs and trial, and (e) visual elements (customer logos, use cases).
  - Acceptance: Page usability test (N users) confirms improved clarity and CTA discoverability. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: usability test size and success metrics]

- **FR-009**: Copilot-Page synergy ‚Äî The Copilot MUST be able to link directly to relevant page sections and the page MUST include contextual prompts that invite users to ask the Copilot for help.
  - Acceptance: For at least 10 content items, the Copilot returns a section link that navigates the user to the relevant page area.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Knowledge Corpus**: Curated collection of Azure Managed Grafana docs, FAQs, marketing content, and approved snippets used to tune or prompt the Copilot.
- **Copilot UI (sidebar)**: Page-embedded assistant component that surfaces responses, citations, copy buttons, and CTAs without obscuring content.
- **Analytics Events**: Structured telemetry packets representing query, response, confidence, user feedback, and navigation actions.
- **Page Content Sections**: Value props, Getting Started, FAQ, Documentation links, Case studies/logos.
- **User Interaction Context**: Session-level metadata used to supply relevant follow-ups (avoid storing PII unless required and defined per policy). [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: intended retention and PII policy]
