# Run unit tests colocated with the backend code, and keep integration/contract
# tests at the repository-level `tests/` folder. This avoids duplicate discovery
# of tests with the same module name in multiple locations.

# Only look in the following test paths (no recursion into backend/tests/integration):
# - backend/tests/unit  (unit tests, colocated with backend code)
# - tests/contract      (contract tests at repo root)
# - tests/integration   (integration tests at repo root)
